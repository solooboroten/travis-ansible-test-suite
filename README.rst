DebOps - Test suite
===================

Chugging away at writing Ansible tests.

What is this repository about?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a test suite for all of the DebOps roles using the
`RoleSpec <https://github.com/nickjj/rolespec>`_ test library.

You can use these tests as a guide for both writing tests using RoleSpec and
as documentation on how to use a specific DebOps role.
